## Transcript

**Jenn:** Welcome to *Sh!t You Don’t Want to Talk About*, where we tackle the uncomfortable and bring light to the dark corners of our minds and society. I'm your host, Jenn Junod, and in this very first episode, I want to set the tone for what this podcast is all about.

**Jenn:** I started this podcast because I believe it’s crucial to have honest conversations about the things we often avoid. Whether it’s mental health, personal struggles, or societal issues, my goal is to create a safe space for these topics to be shared and understood.

**Audience Question:** What made you decide to name the podcast *Sh!t You Don’t Want to Talk About*?  

**Jenn:** Great question! The name reflects the essence of what we’re doing here—addressing the “sh!t” that’s hard to confront but so necessary to discuss. These conversations can be uncomfortable, but they also open the door to healing, growth, and connection.

**Jenn:** Thank you for joining me on this journey. Together, we’ll explore the topics that matter most, even when they’re tough. Stay tuned for the incredible guests and stories we have coming up!
